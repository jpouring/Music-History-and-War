##Initial Hurdles

Working with a dataset as large as having over 1 million records poses its own set of challenges. More so when you personally had no control over the databasing and the general process of things. This is clear when it came to analyzing, our data has multiple potential issues of which we have attempted to correct some while leaving others in. For example there are too many typos to count that needed to be corrected and the overwhelming number of null in multiple categories. Particularly country of publication and composer name which can prove achieving the most accurate of results a challenge. Also they state with their data that if a title appears again with a different category also attached, i.e published in Vienna and London it will be its own separate entity. While it can cause some distortion ultimately we decided to leave this part of the data as is because the popularity of piece is also significant.

Not only is our data challenging to work with but it also has its own problems as shown above. While it demonstrated the many holes we have for Null categories it also shows the extremely skewed locations of publication that our dataset includes. While we would like to assume that the many null categories fall into other regions of earth we can truly make this claim since there is no data so support. So there are some unfortunate problems if we want to make world claims and would probably be off using this data to only talk about things in the western theatre.

##Methods and Findings

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the potential of digital methods in musical studies. That being said there is much to gain even without any complex techniques. For example using only Tableau, a data visualization program it allowed us organize and view our data on a macro level that would have been difficult to achieve using other programs like excel or otherwise. Using the British Musical Archive after all with over 1 million records would prove much too difficult to be able to sift through on the micro level so using simple digital methods to look at things from the macro perspective is far more effective.  Tableau works but having all of your spreadsheet organized with column titles and rows for entries, at least in that is the common standard. So to begin looking at your data you can literally drag and drop all kinds of categories, like in our case coming up with a simple total number of publications by year using over a million individual records.

There is some real powerful ways you can look at your data then these larger trends because frankly sometimes they can be useful but something like a total record count lacks substance. That being said considering this is the english musical archive after all we thought to look at publications that England has done over the span of this archive’s massive five hundred plus years. Which presents us with a perfect case study of how digital methods can be used to help you with minimal effort. So using Tableau to give us a visualization of England's publication across time we instantly stumble into something fascinating.

Interestingly enough every five years we see a significant jump in publications per year. Which continues well into the 1900’s starting in the 1700’s. Given this peculiarity it obviously calls for further investigation. Again, not only looking at England on the macro scale could we see this trend but you can go in deeper and look at it on the micro level.

From here, by looking at just one of those five year intervals we see that there is, unfortunately a high number of null composers are in this year but also a very high spike of just one or two composers. Upon examining a second one of these five year gaps, we see the same ones previously found a high number of null and a few spikes but also as we continue on further into the modern world we see an increase in general number of entries too.

A trend matched by our previous not-that-interesting in the moment visualization from the start that we created. So this could be a very interesting research topic as for our limited look into this matter, the people with spikes all are important playwrights, opera composers and so forth for their time but we found little explanation for these spikes. For example in 1800 Mozart has a spike of his own which is nine years after his death. So for not we have concluded it to just be a databasing decision.

Alright, so what other cool things can we do? Well sticking to countries in a similar way that we looked at england we can compare major historical events and see if there is any kind of reflection in music publishing. For this we looked at Germany and a few other countries apart of the Soviet Bloc.

 As one would expect, of course Austria has a rich history of music so they have a more fleshed out publishing count, but even in a country like The Ukraine in the years When the berlin wall came down and the Soviet Union dissolved we see a spike in musical publications, albeit even a small number but the density during this time is the same across most bloc countries. You can even see it in Germany’s breakdown too. Of course this is interesting in own right because the databasing of Germany’s music is broken into East and West not only because of the country being split for over 40 years but also to distinguish between Each germany with Berlin and Prussia from the other side of the Country. Which just as in Ukraine and Austria when the country is reunited we see a very large spike in music publishing as one, united, Germany.

Countries aren't our only dimension for example we can see the composers with the largest amounts of published music and the top 7 cities they were most published in.

Something like this is just about what one would expect from a british based archive. Also the composers one would expect, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and the likes.

So our dataset in particular is only on published documents, so it would probably be a good idea to look at those too, the publishers.

We have filtered our results here to only show us companies that have over 3000 records for condensing purposes and we find that one certainly stands ahead of the rest with a massive amount of nearly 28,000 published pieces of music. Doing some more simple research we find that Novello is a british based company started in 1811 by a music printer and composer of the same last name, Novello.

Another simple idea we can up with is looking at the popularity of the roles involved in music publishing.

One could examine the role of Editor or Arranger and their rise in popularity of time and maybe make a claim about the renovation of older music. Not to mention the ever common re purpose of music to theatre, orchestra, choir, etc.
